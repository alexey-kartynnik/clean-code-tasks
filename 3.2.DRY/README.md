# Practical task repository for DRY 

## General Task Guidelines

*    Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
*    The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
*    Tasks are C# based and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest language versions while making code updates, but you are able to change language version.
*    It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*    A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*    While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdparty' should be ignored. **Do not modify 'thirdparty' components.** These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*    Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. **Do not modify existent tests.** You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
*    **Logic and behaviour of the code need to be preserved.**
